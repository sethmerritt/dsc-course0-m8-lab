# Aviation Safety Analysis (Flatiron Module 8 Lab)

This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1983–2023 to evaluate injury and destruction risks by aircraft make/model and explore contextual risk factors like weather and engine type.

## Files
- `Aviation_Accidents_Cleaning.ipynb`: full data cleaning workflow
- `Aviation_Accidents_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: EDA, visualizations, recommendations
- `cleaned_aviation_data.csv`: processed dataset used in analysis

## Key Findings
- **Small aircraft**: CESSNA, BEECH, and PIPER show lower injury/destruction rates
- **Large aircraft**: BOEING ranks best, likely due to commercial oversight and infrastructure—not just design
- **Weather and engine type** matter, but are embedded in reporting biases
- Injury/destruction data reflects what gets seen and counted—not just what happens

## Disclaimer
This is not a risk report. It's a reflection of how the archive sees aviation safety. "Minor injury" may mean "we don’t know." What’s absent is structured by power, not just probability.
